2. Calibrate the PiDog
=============================

**Introduction**

Calibrating your PiDog is an essential step to ensure its stable and efficient operation. This process helps correct any imbalances or inaccuracies that might have arisen during assembly or from structural issues. Follow these steps carefully to ensure your PiDog walks steadily and performs as expected.

But if the deviation angle is too big, you still have to go back to :ref:`py_servo_adjust` to set the servo angle to 0Â°, and then follow the instructions to reassemble the PiDog.

**Calibrate Video**

For a comprehensive guide, refer to the full calibration video. It provides a visual step-by-step process to accurately calibrate your PiDog.

**Steps**

The specific steps are as follows:

#. Put the PiDog on the base.

    .. code-block::

        cd ~/pidog/examples
        sudo python3 0_calibration.py
        
    Upon running the script, a user interface will appear in your terminal.
