6. Check I2C and SPI Interface
========================================

We will be using Raspberry Pi's I2C and SPI interfaces. These interfaces should have been enabled when installing the ``robot-hat`` module earlier. To ensure everything is in order, let's check if they are indeed enabled.

#. Input the following command:

    .. raw:: html

        <run></run>

    .. code-block:: 

        sudo raspi-config

#. Choose **Interfacing Options** by press the down arrow key on your keyboard, then press the **Enter** key.

#. Then **I2C**.

    .. image:: img/image283.png
        :align: center

#. Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to select **<Yes>** -> **<OK>** to complete the setup of the I2C.
