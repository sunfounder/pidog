Assemble Videos
==============================================

Before assembling the PiDog, please first verify that all parts and components have been included. If there are any missing or damaged components, please contact SunFounder immediately at service@sunfounder.com to resolve the issue as soon as possible.

Please follow the steps on the following PDF for assembly instructions: 

* :Download:`Component List and Assembly Instructions <https://github.com/sunfounder/sf-pdf/raw/master/assembly_file/z0111v12-a0000966-pidog.pdf>`.

Afterward, you can continue following the instructions in the video below from **2:28** onwards to assemble it.


**Assembly Tutorial Video(Raspberry Pi 4/3/1 Model)**

This video will walk you through the process of assembling your robot from scratch.

In this tutorial, you will learn:

* **Preparation**: We'll introduce you to all the tools and parts needed, ensuring you're fully equipped before starting the assembly.

* **Assembly Steps**: We'll demonstrate each assembly step in a systematic manner.

* **Tips and Considerations**: Throughout the process, we'll share essential tips and tricks to help you avoid common mistakes and ensure your robot operates smoothly.

* **Zeroing a Servo**: Before fixing each servo, it needs to be zeroed first. The steps for zeroing are to first install the Raspberry Pi OS, then install the required modules, and then run a script (set the angle of all PWM pins to 0). After that, plug in the servo wire to zero the servo.


The assembly process for Pidog is quite long, so we have divided it into two videos. The first video covers assembling Pidog's body and four legs.
