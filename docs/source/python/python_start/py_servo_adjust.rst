Servo Adjust
===============

To ensure that the servo has been properly set to 0째, first insert the rocker arm into the servo shaft and then gently rotate the rocker arm to a different angle.

Follow the instructions on the assembly foldout, insert the battery holder cable and turn the power switch to the ON. Wait for 1-2 minutes, there will be a sound to indicate that the Raspberry Pi boots successfully.

Now, run ``servo_zeroing.py`` in the ``examples/`` folder.

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd /home/pi/pidog/examples
    sudo python3 servo_zeroing.py


.. note::
    If you get an error, try re-enabling the Raspberry Pi's I2C port, see: :ref:`i2c_config`.

Next, plug the servo cable into the **any PWM port**.

At this point you will see the servo arm rotate to a specific position (0째). If the servo arm does not return to 0째, press the RST button to restart the Robot HAT.

Now you can continue the installation as instructed on the assembly foldout.

.. note::

    * Do not unplug this servo cable before fixing it with the servo screw, you can unplug it after fixing it.
    * Do not rotate the servo while it is powered on to avoid damage; if the servo shaft is not inserted at the right angle, pull the servo out and reinsert it.
    * Before assembling each servo, you need to plug the servo cable into PWM pin and turn on the power to set its angle to 0째.
