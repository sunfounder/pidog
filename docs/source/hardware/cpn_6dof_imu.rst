The 6-DOF IMU is based on the SH3001.

SH3001 is a six-axis IMU (Inertial measurement unit). It integrates a three-axis gyroscope and a three-axis accelerometer. It is small in size and low in power consumption. It is suitable for consumer electronics market applications and can provide high-precision real-time angular velocity and linear acceleration data. The SH3001 has excellent temperature stability and can maintain high resolution within the operating range of -40Â°C to 85Â°C.

It is typically used in smartphones, tablet computers, multi-rotor drones, smart sweepers, page-turning laser pointers, AR/VR, smart remote controls, smart bracelets and other products.
