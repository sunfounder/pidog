Robot HAT
==================
|link_robot_hat_v4| is a multifunctional expansion board that allows Raspberry Pi to be quickly turned into a robot. 
An MCU is on board to extend the PWM output and ADC input for the Raspberry Pi, 
as well as a motor driver chip, I2S audio module and mono speaker. 
As well as the GPIOs that lead out of the Raspberry Pi itself.

It also comes with a Speaker, 
which can be used to play background music, sound effects and implement TTS functions to make your project more interesting.

Accepts 7-12V PH2.0 5pin power input with 2 battery indicators, 1 charge indicator and 1 power indicator. 
The board also has a user available LED and a button for you to quickly test some effects.

**Power Port**
    * 7-12V PH2.0 3pin power input.
    * Powering the Raspberry Pi and Robot HAT at the same time.

**Power Switch**
    * Turn on/off the power of the robot HAT.
    * When you connect power to the power port, the Raspberry Pi will boot up. However, you will need to switch the power switch to ON to enable Robot HAT.

**Type-C USB Port**
    * Insert the Type-C cable to charge the battery.
    * At the same time, the charging indicator lights up in red color.
    * When the battery is fully charged, the charging indicator turns off.
    * If the USB cable is still plugged in about 4 hours after it is fully charged, the charging indicator will blink to prompt.

**Digital Pin**
    * 4-channel digital pins, D0-D3.

**ADC Pin**
    * 4-channel ADC pins, A0-A3.

**PWM Pin**
    * 12-channel PWM pins, P0-P11.

**Left/Right Motor Port**
    * 2-channel XH2.54 motor ports.
    * The left port is connected to GPIO 4 and the right port is connected to GPIO 5.

**I2C Pin and I2C Port**
    * **I2C Pin**: P2.54 4-pin interface.
    * **I2C Port**: SH1.0 4-pin interface, which is compatible with QWIIC and STEMMA QT. 
    * These I2C interfaces are connected to the Raspberry Pi's I2C interface via GPIO2 (SDA) and GPIO3 (SCL).

**SPI Pin**
    * P2.54 7-pin SPI interface.

**UART Pin**
    * P2.54 4-pin interface.

**RST Button**
    * The RST button, when using Ezblock, serves as a button to restart the Ezblock program. 
    * If not using Ezblock, the RST button does not have a predefined function and can be fully customized according to your needs.

**USR Button**
    * The functions of USR Button can be set by your programming. (Pressing down leads to a input ‚Äú0‚Äù; releasing produces a input ‚Äú1‚Äù. ) 

**Battery Indicator**
    * Two LEDs light up when the voltage is higher than 7.6V.
    * One LED lights up in the 7.15V to 7.6V range. 
    * Below 7.15V, both LEDs turn off.

**Speaker and Speaker Port**
    * **Speaker**: This is a 2030 audio chamber speaker.
    * **Speaker Port**: The Robot HAT is equipped with onboard I2S audio output, along with a 2030 audio chamber speaker, providing a mono sound output.
