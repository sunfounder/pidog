6. Be Picked Up
===================

Try lifting your PiDog from the ground, PiDog will feel like it can fly, and it will cheer in a superman pose.

**Run the Code**

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/pidog/examples
    sudo python3 6_be_picked_up.py

After the program runs, the 6-DOF IMU Module will always calculate the acceleration in the vertical direction.
If PiDog is calculated to be in a state of weightlessness, PiDog assumes a superman pose and cheers.
Otherwise, consider PiDog to be on flat ground and make a standing pose.



**Code**

.. note::
    You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to source code path like ``pidog\examples``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.
